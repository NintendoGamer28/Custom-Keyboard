HOW TO USE:

WARNING !!!
-----------
I am not responsible if you brick your keyboard in anyway, If you do brick your keyboard
you'll need to launch homebrew and open FBI (Homebrew Version) the reason why you need to
load the homebrew version is because when you open the .cia version it will try to load the
pin keyboard what is part of the actual keyboard and because your keyboard is corrupted it will
freeze you. Just install the original keyboard .cia provided in the zip "000400300000D002.cia"
-----------

1. Drag the NG28Keyboard.cia to your SD Card either in the cia folder or the root

2. On your 3DS open FBI or another cia installing application and install the NG28Keyboard.cia

3. Open the friend list application and see if it has installed.
